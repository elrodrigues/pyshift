# PyShift

This is a repository documenting my work on carbon-aware transfer schedulers at UB as part of the Data Intensive Distributed Computing (DIDC) lab. 
A good chunk of my work is in notebooks which is not super amenable for git due to their often large artifact size. I'll figure out a way to add them here.

Designs for the first scheduler started in December 2024 with first commit in January 2025.
